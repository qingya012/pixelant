## Technical Overview

### Pixelated Antenna Model

![Pixelated Antenna](pixelated_patch.png)

- Base patch tessellated into **12×12 binary pixels**
- Each pixel represents metal (1) or no-metal (0)
- Feed-adjacent pixels fixed to ensure connectivity
- Avoids template bias, enables non-intuitive geometries

### Tandem Neural Network Architecture

![Tandem Architecture](tandem_architecture.png)

The tandem architecture consists of:

1. **Inverse Network**: Maps desired S₁₁(f) spectrum → pixelated geometry
2. **Forward CNN Surrogate**: Maps geometry → S₁₁(f) (frozen weights)
3. **Joint Training**: Ensures data consistency despite non-unique inverse mapping

**Loss Function:**
```
L = L_S + α·L_D + β·L_B
```
- L_S: Spectrum prediction error
- L_D: Design consistency error
- L_B: Binary regularization term

**Smooth Thresholding Activation:**
```
f(x) = 0.5 + 0.5·tanh(m(x - 0.5))
```
Enforces binary outputs during training, not as post-processing.

### Transfer Learning Strategy

![Transfer Learning Flow](transfer_learning_flow.png)

**Motivation:** Air-filled simulations are 50-60× faster than dielectric simulations.

**Workflow:**
1. Train forward CNN on 500k air-filled antennas (10-20 GHz)
2. Apply scaling laws to map air designs to dielectric domain
3. Fine-tune with 60k dielectric antennas (FR-4, 1-5 GHz)
4. Achieve 88% reduction in simulation cost

**Scaling Law:**
```
w_d = a·w_a,  where  a = f_a / (f_d·√ε_eff)
```
Typical scale factors: 2-5 for migration from 10-20 GHz (air) to 1-5 GHz (FR-4).

% Define a 12×12 binary antenna design
ant_design = randi([0,1], 12, 12);
ant_design(6:7, 1) = 1;  % Ensure feed connectivity

% Generate antenna structure (13 = 12 pixels + 1)
antenna = generateantenna_air(13, 13, ant_design);

% Simulate S-parameters
freq = linspace(10e9, 20e9, 81);
s = sparameters(antenna, freq, 50);
rfplot(s, 1, 1);
```

**Inputs:**

generateantenna_for_tandem_air(13, 13, 1000);

% Output: Individual .mat files (output1.mat, output2.mat, ...)
% Each contains: Test_patches (144×1 design vector), spec (81×1 S11 spectrum)
```

**Note:** Uses 8 parallel workers. Adjust `parpool('local', 8)` based on available cores.

### Use Case 3: Transfer Learning for Dielectric Substrates

## Important Notes and Limitations

### Scope of Implementation

**The code provided in this repository covers specific use cases:**
- 12×12 pixelated microstrip antennas
- Air and FR-4 substrates
- Frequency ranges: 10-20 GHz (air), 1-5 GHz (FR-4)
- Single-band and limited multi-band designs

**The algorithms in the published papers can be instantiated in many other settings NOT covered in this repository, including:**
- Different pixel grid resolutions (e.g., 16×16, 24×24)
- Alternative substrate materials (Rogers, alumina, etc.)
- Different frequency bands (sub-GHz, mmWave, sub-THz)
- Other antenna types (slots, monopoles, arrays)
- Different EM objectives (gain, efficiency, radiation patterns)
- Multi-port networks and RF passives (see Nature Comm. paper)

### Computational Requirements

- **Dataset generation:** Computationally intensive; 500k air antennas ≈ weeks on 8-core workstation
- **Pre-trained models provided:** Use these to avoid re-training
- **Neural network training:** Requires GPU (8+ GB VRAM recommended)
- **Inference:** Fast on CPU (< 1 second per design)

### Validation

**All neural network predictions should be validated with full-wave EM simulation before fabrication.** The surrogate models provide excellent approximations but may have errors for edge cases or out-of-distribution designs.
